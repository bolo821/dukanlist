          provides a variety of Forums (as defined in 'Terms of Use') for its

          entity, re-organize, amalgamate or restructure its business. If such a
          transaction occurs, that other business entity or the new entity

          to process postal mailing. Again, such an agency would be bound by
          strict confidentiality agreements that limit their use of such
          information
